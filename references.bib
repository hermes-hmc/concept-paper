@unpublished{11045035/FNK2BYH3, title={FAIR Principles for Research Software (FAIR4RS Principles)}, url={https://doi.org/10.15497/RDA00065}, DOI={10.15497/RDA00065}, abstractNote={Research software is a fundamental and vital part of research worldwide, yet there remain significant challenges to software productivity, quality, reproducibility, and sustainability. Improving the practice of scholarship is a common goal of the open science, open source software and FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) communities, but improving the sharing of research software has not yet been a strong focus of the latter. To improve the FAIRness of research software, the FAIR for Research Software (FAIR4RS) Working Group has sought to understand how to apply the FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship to research software, bringing together existing and new community efforts. Many of the FAIR Guiding Principles can be directly applied to research software by treating software and data as similar digital research objects. However, specific characteristics of software — such as its executability, composite nature, and continuous evolution and versioning — make it necessary to revise and extend the principles. This document presents the first version of the FAIR Principles for Research Software (FAIR4RS Principles). It is an outcome of the FAIR for Research Software Working Group (FAIR4RS WG). The FAIR for Research Software Working Group is jointly convened as an RDA Working Group, FORCE11 Working Group, and Research Software Alliance (ReSA) Task Force.}, note={Publisher: Research Data Alliance}, author={Chue Hong, Neil P. and Katz, Daniel S. and Barker, Michelle and Lamprecht, Anna-Lena and Martinez, Carlos and Psomopoulos, Fotis E. and Harrow, Jen and Castro, Leyla Jael and Gruenpeter, Morane and Martinez, Paula Andrea and Honeyman, Tom and Struck, Alexander and Lee, Allen and Loewe, Axel and van Werkhove, Ben and Jones, Catherine and Garijo, Daniel and Plomp, Esther and Genova, Francoise and Shanahan, Hugh and Leng, Joanna and Hellström, Maggie and Sandström, Malin and Sinha, Manodeep and Kuzak, Mateusz and Herterich, Patricia and Zhang, Qian and Islam, Sharif and Sansone, Susanna-Assunta and Pollard, Tom and Atmojo, Udayanto Dwi and Williams, Alan and Czerniak, Andreas and Niehues, Anna and Fouilloux, Anne Claire and Desinghu, Bala and Goble, Carole and Richard, Céline and Gray, Charles and Erdmann, Chris and Nüst, Daniel and Tartarini, Daniele and Ranguelova, Elena and Anzt, Hartwig and Todorov, Ilian and McNally, James and Moldon, Javier and Burnett, Jessica and Garrido-Sánchez, Julián and Belhajjame, Khalid and Sesink, Laurents and Hwang, Lorraine and Tovani-Palone, Marcos Roberto and Wilkinson, Mark D. and Servillat, Mathieu and Liffers, Matthias and Fox, Merc and Miljković, Nadica and Lynch, Nick and Martinez Lavanchy, Paula and Gesing, Sandra and Stevens, Sarah and Martinez Cuesta, Sergio and Peroni, Silvio and Soiland-Reyes, Stian and Bakker, Tom and Rabemanantsoa, Tovo and Sochat, Vanessa and Yehudi, Yo}, year={2021} }

@article{138880/DPXVI66D, title={A Fresh Look at FAIR for Research Software}, url={http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.10883}, abstractNote={This document captures the discussion and deliberation of the FAIR for Research Software (FAIR4RS) subgroup that took a fresh look at the applicability of the FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship for research software. We discuss the vision of research software as ideally reproducible, open, usable, recognized, sustained and robust, and then review both the characteristic and practiced differences of research software and data. This vision and understanding of initial conditions serves as a backdrop for an attempt at translating and interpreting the guiding principles to more fully align with research software. We have found that many of the principles remained relatively intact as written, as long as considerable interpretation was provided. This was particularly the case for the “Findable” and “Accessible” foundational principles. We found that “Interoperability” and “Reusability” are particularly prone to a broad and sometimes opposing set of interpretations as written. We propose two new principles modeled on existing ones, and provide modified guiding text for these principles to help clarify our final interpretation. A series of gaps in translation were captured during this process, and these remain to be addressed. We finish with a consideration of where these translated principles fall short of the vision laid out in the opening.}, note={arXiv: 2101.10883}, journal={arXiv:2101.10883 [cs]}, author={Katz, Daniel S. and Gruenpeter, Morane and Honeyman, Tom and Hwang, Lorraine and Wilkinson, Mark D. and Sochat, Vanessa and Anzt, Hartwig and Goble, Carole and 1, for FAIR4RS Subgroup}, year={2021}, month={Feb} }

To investigate the practices and trends of statistical analysis in empirical software engineering (ESE), this paper presents a review of a large pool of papers from top-ranked software engineering journals. First, we manually reviewed 161 papers and in the second phase of our method, we conducted a more extensive semi-automatic classification of papers spanning the years 2001--2015 and 5,196 papers. Results from both review steps was used to: i) identify and analyze the predominant practices in ESE (e.g., using t-test or ANOVA), as well as relevant trends in usage of specific statistical methods (e.g., nonparametric tests and effect size measures) and, ii) develop a conceptual model for a statistical analysis workflow with suggestions on how to apply different statistical methods as well as guidelines to avoid pitfalls. Lastly, we confirm existing claims that current ESE practices lack a standard to report practical significance of results. We illustrate how practical significance can be discussed in terms of both the statistical analysis and in the practitioner’s context.}, note={arXiv: 1706.00933}, journal={arXiv:1706.00933 [cs]}, author={Neto, Francisco Gomes de Oliveira and Torkar, Richard and Feldt, Robert and Gren, Lucas and Furia, Carlo A. and Huang, Ziwei}, year={2019}, month={Jul} }

Sie ist entweder selbst Gegenstand der Forschung oder wird als Hilfsmittel zur Erfassung, Verarbeitung und Analyse von Forschungsdaten eingesetzt. Zur Nachvollziehbarkeit der durchgeführten Forschung sollte Software langfristig verfügbar gemacht werden. Im SARA-Projekt zwischen der Universität Konstanz und der Universität Ulm wird ein Dienst entwickelt, der versucht die Einschränkungen bereits bestehender Angebote aufzuheben. Dies beinhaltet u.a. die Möglichkeit, die gesamte Entwicklungshistorie auf einfache Weise mitzuveröffentlichen und für Dritte zur Online-Exploration anzubieten. Zudem bestimmen die Forschenden den Zeitpunkt und Umfang der zu archivierenden/veröffentlichenden Software-Artefakte selbst. Der SARA-Dienst sieht auch die Möglichkeit vor, eine Archivierung ohne Veröffentlichung vorzunehmen. Der geplante Dienst verbindet bereits bestehende Publikations- und Forschungsinfrastrukturen miteinander. Er ermöglicht aus der Arbeitsumgebung der Forschenden heraus eine Archivierung und Veröffentlichung von Software und unterstützt Forschende dabei, bereits prozessbegleitend Zwischenstände ihrer Forschung festzuhalten. Aufgrund seines modularen Aufbaus kann der SARA-Dienst in unterschiedlichen Szenarien zum Einsatz kommen, beispielsweise als kooperativer Dienst für mehrere Einrichtungen. Er stellt eine sinnvolle Ergänzung zu bestehenden Angeboten im Forschungsdatenmanagement dar. Software plays an important role in many scientific disciplines. Whether software itself is the research focus or whether software tools are used to create, process and analyse data – software should be available for the long term to make the research process reproducible. In the context of the SARA project conducted by the University of Konstanz and Ulm University, a service is being developed which aims to avoid restrictions of existing services. This includes the possibility to easily publish the whole change history and make it available for others to explore online. Additionally, the researchers decide when and what they want to archive/publish. The SARA service also allows for archiving of software without making it publicly accessible. It connects existing publication and research infrastructures. Researchers can trigger a publication of software from their research environment and are encouraged to publish software artefacts already during the research process. The new service can be used in various scenarios due to its modular design, for example as a cooperative service for several institutions. The SARA Service is a useful addition to already existing research data management services.}, note={Artwork Size: 92-105 Seiten
